Game Description:
Dive into an exhilarating underwater adventure with our captivating game! Take control of a mighty shark,
using arrow keys to maneuver through the vast ocean. Your objective? 
Devour smaller sea creatures to grow larger and feast upon rival sharks. To emerge victorious, you must survive against relentless opponents and strategically outmaneuver them.

As you navigate the depths, be wary of treacherous mines and avoid colliding with other sharks. Your health is paramount, decreasing with each mishap or encounter. A depleting health bar brings you closer to defeat, so employ swift reflexes and cunning tactics to ensure your survival.

The game boasts an immersive design that leverages various classes. At its core is the "GameObj" class, serving as the foundation for all static and movable entities. Orchestrating the gameplay is the "Controller," a masterful game manager responsible for initiating the adventure and overseeing its progression. The "Board," nestled within the Controller, houses the diverse array of game objects and drives pivotal actions such as movement and collisions.

Among the captivating classes is "enemyShark," a subclass inheriting from "moveable," and "enemy," which, in turn, derives from "enemyShark." These classes embody the relentless pursuit of rival sharks, skillfully tracking and homing in on your shark when within a certain distance. With captivating intelligence, enemies dynamically adapt their movements, amplifying the challenge and excitement.

Immersing players in a visually stunning world, our game encompasses various enthralling entities. From agile crabs and mesmerizing jellyfish to majestic lionfish and iconic Nemo, each sea creature exudes distinct movements and behaviors, adding depth to the gameplay. The ocean's inhabitants dance in harmony with your shark's movements, creating an immersive and realistic experience.

Utilizing cutting-edge algorithms, our game implements physics-based movement for the shark and other moveable entities. Fish and sea creatures elegantly shift their trajectories, responding to your presence or following predefined patterns. Intelligent enemies utilize advanced strategies, approaching with calculated precision or unleashing unpredictable maneuvers.

Our collision system employs a meticulous PixelPerfectTest algorithm, ensuring accurate and seamless interactions between objects. This enhances gameplay realism and guarantees that every collision has tangible consequences.

Immerse yourself in a richly detailed underwater environment, where vibrant animations and meticulously crafted sound effects enhance the overall experience. With a seamless blend of stunning visuals, captivating gameplay, and dynamic challenges, our game promises hours of entertainment and adrenaline-pumping excitement.

Embark on this thrilling underwater odyssey and prove your dominance in the vast expanse of the ocean. Can you emerge as the apex predator, conquering all adversaries and claiming victory? Prepare to dive into an unforgettable gaming experience that will leave you craving for more!
